												<p>Chemical agents are poisonous vapors, aerosols, liquids, and solids
													that have toxic health effects. Chemical attacks could occur without
													warning and injury or death often occurs shortly after exposure. The
													availability of effective MCMs against chemical threats are critical
													in the treatment of their acute health effects following exposures.
													The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today
													announced the opening of an Easy Broad Agency Announcement (EZ-BAA)
													for development of repurposed therapeutics as medical
													countermeasures against chemical threats and is now accepting
													abstract <a href="https://drive.hhs.gov/partner.html#ncov"
														target="_blank">submissions</a> for potential funding.</p>

												<p>Under this <a
														href="https://beta.sam.gov/opp/6d5f514d69c94f60ae277f4ec33ca68d/view"
														target="_blank">EZ BAA</a>, the Biomedical Advanced Research and
													Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the
													Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, will review
													concise abstract submissions for funding of repurposing easily
													accessible therapeutics as medical countermeasures against threats
													such as chlorine gas, opioid exposures, and nerve agents. To learn
													more, please visit <a href="https://www.tdbgov.com/"

												<p>New vaccine delivery technologies could provide individuals with a
													broader range of options for immunization, including ones that are
													easier to use and potentially more effective than traditional
													vaccination with needle and syringe. With the potential for
													self-administration, these technologies could also expand the range
													of available care settings, allowing for wider coverage and
													ultimately improving the capability to reach herd immunity for many
													diseases. </p>

												<p>BARDA will explore the feasibility of two innovative approaches with
													four new partners: Esperovax, Inc., the University of Connecticut,
													Vaxess Technologies, and Verndari, Inc. The novel routes of
													administration they are developing could reduce the dependence on
													needles and syringes that are used to deliver vaccine via
													intramuscular injection. Instead, a wearable skin patch or oral
													option for vaccines may support rapid, large-scale immunization
													while reducing the strain on the manufacturing supply chain. </p>

												<p>The Egress RD<sup>TM</sup> mRMA oral cellular delivery technology
													from Esperovax, Inc. is a technology aiming to provide a
													cost-effective immunization that improves uptake with the potential
													for self-administration. </p>

												<p>The other vaccine technologies – from the University of Connecticut,
													Vaxess and Verndari – collectively known as Micro Array Patches
													(MAP), would deliver vaccine using a microneedle patch worn on the
													skin as an alternative to standard inoculation. </p>

												<p>With support from BARDA, the four partners will each advance the
													development of their respective products, formulate and optimize
													materials, and demonstrate their ability to effectively administer
													vaccine. If successful, these technologies could have a profound
													impact on the potential to offer better options to improve vaccine
													coverage. </p>

												<h3>About the Companies: </h3>
												<p><i>The following information is provided by the company and does not
														indicate an endorsement by the federal government of the company
														or its products.</i></p>

												<h4>Esperovax:</h4>
												<p>Esperovax looks to become the global leader in oral tablet/capsule
													vaccinations for some of the world's deadliest treatable diseases by
													leveraging its new oral vaccine platform. Their delivery system
													holds the potential to provide billions of doses annually that could
													be delivered by mail and consumed directly by the consumer without
													the need to visit a healthcare setting. The oral platform holds a
													potential for significant expansion of vaccination to the most
													vulnerable and in need, at a fraction of traditional cost.
												</p>

												<h4>The University of Connecticut (UConn):</h4>
												<p>Dr. Nguyen and his lab at UConn have developed a process to
													manufacture a vaccine microneedle (MN) skin patch that only requires
													single-time administration to automatically deliver vaccine antigens
													repeatedly, similar to the use of multiple bolus injections, over a
													long period. They have shown that the MNs can deliver a clinical
													vaccine of Prevnar-13 against the pneumococcal infection (which
													causes pneumonia like COVID-19). They have started the study on the
													S-protein from a small urgent funding from UConn, School of
													Engineering to test/stabilize the S-protein (as a COVID-19 vaccine)
													in their MNs, and evaluate the antigenicity of the vaccine MNs (with
													only single administration) for a long-term immune-protection in an
													animal model.
												</p>

												<h4>Vaxess Technologies, Inc.:</h4>
												<p>Vaxess is developing next-generation vaccines that are not only more
													protective but also more accessible for people at home and around
													the world. Vaxess is developing its proprietary MIMIX<sup>™
													</sup>therapies based on technology originally developed at Tufts
													University and MIT. With just minutes of wear-time, the
													shelf-stable, self-applied MIMIX<sup>™</sup> patch enables sustained
													release of treatments in the skin over weeks to months. Vaxess is a
													venture-funded company that is also supported by the NIH, NSF, and
													DARPA.
												</p>

												<h4>Verndari:</h4>
												<p>Verndari, Inc. was founded in 2015 with the goal of transforming
													global health through next generation vaccine development and
													delivery. The privately held company based in Napa, California, aims
													to treat existing and emerging diseases, with rapid response to new
													viral threats such as COVID-19 as well as to produce more effective
													vaccinations for existing viruses, such as influenza, enabling
													delivery at lower cost to populations around the world. Verndari’s
													unique VaxiPatch™, a single-dose vaccination kit using a microneedle
													dermal technology, offers advantages that include dose sparing,
													improved efficacy, and pain-free delivery - while making vaccine
													administration much simpler. The technology eliminates the need for
													refrigeration and facilitates high-volume automated manufacturing of
													vaccines. Through innovation in vaccine science, Verndari aims to
													address many different diseases and to save countless lives. For
													more information on Verndari, please visit <a

												<p>BARDA is partnering with Colorado State University’s Infectious
													Disease Research Center (IDRC) to further develop
													SolaVAX<sup>TM</sup>. The SolaVAX <sup>TM</sup> platform uses a
													proprietary technology to inactivate a virus with low risk to the
													patient. This project will demonstrate the utility of the SolaVAX
													<sup>TM</sup> process to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The technology is
													expandable with potential to advance vaccine manufacturing
													capabilities to meet vaccine needs globally. </p>

												<p>The SolaVAX <sup>TM</sup> process utilizes Riboflavin and UV light to
													carry out specific DNA and RNA chemistry with viral, bacterial, or
													cellular agents that subsequently may be used in vaccine
													preparations. The photochemistry of Riboflavin and UV light has been
													shown to be specific to nucleic acids and not induce damage or
													modification to the viral protein antigens that serve as the
													immunogens in the host. By preventing replication of the target
													agent, such as the SARS-COV-2 virus, while minimizing or reducing
													the amount of peripheral damage caused, a particle can be generated
													that contains all the potential antigenic targets for immune
													response without the capacity for replication post-infection. </p>

												<p>Researchers at Colorado State University intend to test this platform
													with stock virus cultures grown in the CSU’s BioMARC BSL-3 facility,
													a cGMP compliant manufacturing facility operated by the University
													on a non-profit basis. BioMARC has the capability and capacity to
													produce large quantities of viruses, perform inactivation
													procedures, and operates BSL-3 labs safely for high-containment
													biological manufacturing operations. This facility was established
													as a Regional Center of Excellence and currently operates as part of
													the Regional Biocontainment/National Biocontainment laboratory
													network under the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
													Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. </p>

												<p>During this pandemic, the ability to produce large quantities of
													vaccines in a cost-effective manner is critical. The SolaVAX
													<sup>TM</sup> platform has already been shown to inactivate
													MERS-CoV, another virus in the coronavirus family, efficiently and
													has been evaluated for production in other types of vaccine delivery
													systems. The specific technology used in the SolaVAX platform
													provides for low toxicity and thus easy handling, distribution, and
													manufacturing of vaccines. The technology may provide an
													inexpensive, fast, safe, clean, and potentially better inactivation
													technology than what is currently available.</p>

												<p>BARDA and Empatica embark on a new partnership to develop and seek
													U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization for
													Aura, a wearable system and algorithm that can serve as an early
													warning platform for COVID-19 infections.</p>

												<p>This system will utilize a wearable physiological monitor, Empatica’s
													E4 wristband device, to detect early signs of infection in
													individuals. Study participants also will self-collect daily nasal
													swabs, self-report symptoms, and self-collect daily saturated oxygen
													read-outs for analysis by Empatica. All data will be used to
													fine-tune and validate Empatica’s early diagnostic algorithm, which
													will provide a probability of infection.</p>


												<img alt="Empatica Wearable" class="img-fluid"
													src="assets/images/thumbnail_empatica_aura_press_release_drive_nologos.jpg"><br>
												<br>
												<p>The results will be shared with the user via a mobile application and
													a caregiver through a web dashboard. The overall goal of the
													platform is to provide an early warning to COVID-19 contagion,
													helping reduce the transmission of infected individuals and save
													lives. </p>

												<p>Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may only seek diagnostic tests
													once they begin exhibiting symptoms. Empatica aims to disrupt this
													health-care paradigm by detecting infection in individuals before
													the onset of symptoms. This project will leverage data from a
													previous partnership with BARDA on early detection of respiratory
													infection, and include a clinical study monitoring at-risk
													healthcare workers for COVID-19. The goal is to alert healthcare
													workers and patients to infection early, preventing further spread
													by allowing for early self-quarantine, treatment, and care.</p>

												<p>In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and a surge of critically
													ill patients being admitted to hospitals, healthcare providers need
													technologies that can assist with rapid early identification of
													patients likely to progress to severe disease that need clinical
													intervention. Immunexpress has developed SeptiCyte<sup>®</sup>
													RAPID, a host-based gene expression assay to rapidly assess patients
													suspected of infection for their likelihood to progress to sepsis.
													SeptiCyte<sup>®</sup> RAPID will be validated for its ability to
													effectively triage COVID-19 patients for risk of viral sepsis.</p>

												<p>The SeptiCyte<sup>®</sup> host response assay uses a novel gene
													signature for rapid assessment of a patient’s immune response to
													infection. The test uses an automated cartridge format on the
													Biocartis IdyllaTM molecular diagnostic platform and provides
													results in less than 90 minutes. The overall solution is expected to
													allow clinicians to detect patients at risk of increased disease

												<p>BARDA and Snapdragon Chemistry Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, will
													work together over the next year to develop and demonstrate an
													innovative continuous manufacturing platform to produce
													ribonucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), a critical raw material for <a
														href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Findex.html"
														target="_blank">COVID-19</a> vaccines that use messenger RNA
													technology. The project includes a rapidly scalable, continuous
													manufacturing process for the chemical synthesis and purification of
													NTPs.</p>

												<p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) is present in all living cells and carries
													instructions from the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of one cell to
													another. Currently, one of the <a
														href="https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx"
														target="_blank">COVID-19 vaccines</a> being developed with
													federal funding use mRNA technology and rely on NTPs.</p>

												<p>With a small footprint and low capital cost, multiple identical
													platforms can be deployed to vaccine manufacturing facilities in the
													United States, providing a more reliable way of producing the NTP
													component of some COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

												<p>BARDA and OraSure Technology, Inc. are partnering again, this time on
													development of an in vitro (laboratory) diagnostic to detect
													antibodies for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in oral fluids. Currently there
													are no SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests based on oral fluids available for
													high-throughput ELISA screening.</p>

												<p>Although the test could be used at point of care facilities such as
													doctors’ offices, clinics, or hospitals, the goal is to have
													patients collect their own saliva samples at home to maintain social
													distancing and then ship their sample to the lab. Oral fluid
													collection is non-invasive and requires less human contact in
													comparison to blood draw. At-home self-collection also minimizes
													health care workers’ exposure to potentially infected patients and
													permits a large number of individuals to be screened quickly. </p>

												<p>OraSure plans to leverage the 510(k) cleared Drugs of Abuse (DOA)
													ELISA platform as the starting point to develop this ELISA-based
													coronavirus antibody test. The test is being designed to run on
													automated ELISA instruments, such as Hamilton and Dynex instruments.
													Development includes a version of the test to detect human
													anti-Nucleocapsid protein (NP) and/or human anti-Spike 1 (S1) total
													antibody for the screening of acute infection in a symptomatic
													population. </p>

												<p>Both human anti-NP and anti-S1 IgM and IgG antibodies have been
													reported to rise in COVID-19 patients within days after the onset of
													symptoms. With BARDA support, OraSure expects to request FDA’s
													Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug
													Administration within the next five months or sooner. If the EUA is
													granted, usability and flex studies will be conducted to support
													self-collection use of the device for home collections and the
													company will submit data as an amendment to the EUA. </p>

												<p>BARDA is pleased to announce a partnership with Evidation Health of
													San Mateo, California, to monitor healthcare workers and first
													responders by leveraging de-identified, patient-generated health
													data from existing wearable devices as an early warning algorithm to
													identify early symptoms of COVID-19. </p>

												<p>This study is part of BARDA’s Rapidly Deployable Capabilities program
													to identify and pilot near term innovative solutions for identifying
													individuals who have COVID-19 infections. Individual and
													population-based data will be collated into computer models to
													improve “real-time” COVID-19 incidence prediction of both
													symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and enhance current disease
													surveillance systems to detect respiratory infections prior to the
													onset of symptoms.</p>

												<p>SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is highly transmissible
													and is causing unprecedented social behavior changes in the country
													as many are being impacted by stay-at- home guidance’s from health
													officials. One of the biggest challenges with combating the virus is
													being able to detect those who are infected but either have not yet
													progressed to symptoms or will not show symptoms of the disease, as
													these individuals may be able to transmit without realizing it. In
													addition, the symptoms of COVID-19 appear to vary greatly in
													individuals and over the course of infection, and these will be
													correlated with confirmed COViD-19 diagnosis and hospitalization.
												</p>

												<p>This project builds on Evidation’s current partnership with BARDA to
													monitor individuals for respiratory infections, such as influenza.
													This pilot study will demonstrate utility of empowering Americans
													with a novel means to self-monitor to improve health outcomes for
													COVID-19. The study will initiate with healthcare workers and first
													responders, who are our nation’s front-line responders, to more
													readily be diagnosed to prevent exposure to others. The study has
													the potential for large-scale deployment to allow Americans to
													determine risk of COVID-19 and to appropriately implement
													precautions against spread of COVID-19 and other such diseases.

													health, including QT interval changes which may require an
													escalation in care.</p>

												<p>The elderly and individuals with underlying medical conditions may be
													at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Early
													indication of patient deterioration or cardiac arrhythmia will allow
													healthcare professionals to intervene earlier in order to improve
													clinical management of patients and health outcomes. These pilot
													clinical studies will be conducted as part of quality improvement to
													support use of these remote monitoring technologies as adjunctive
													diagnostic health support. </p>

												<p>The Vista Solution incorporates four primary components; The
													VitalPatch clinical grade biosensor, a Vista Tablet, the VitalCloud,
													and the VistaCenter central monitoring station. Through the Vista
													Solution, clinicians can monitor up to 11 different patient vitals
													in real-time including those captured by the VitalPatch (single-lead
													EKG, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, body
													temperature, body posture, fall detection, activity) and those
													captured by 3rd party devices (blood oxygen, weight, blood
													pressure). COVID-19 patients suffer from a variety of symptoms
													including respiratory distress, low blood oxygen levels, and cardiac
													arrhythmia, which can all be monitored with the Vista Solution.</p>

													predicting the likelihood of viral sepsis</i></p>

											<p>BARDA and Cytovale, Inc. are expanding their partnership for additional
												advanced research and development of a diagnostic system being designed
												to diagnose sepsis in less than 10 minutes.</p>

											<p>Cytovale’s rapid diagnostic system is a deformability cytometry platform,
												meaning that it analyzes the biomechanical properties of immune cells;
												this method may enable early and rapid diagnosis of sepsis. Receiving
												results in less than 10 minutes would enable timely and accurate triage
												in the emergency department, allow for more effective identification and
												treatment of sepsis, and help optimize use of valuable hospital
												resources.</p>

											<p>To validate this rapid diagnostic system in identifying patients at risk
												of viral sepsis, Cytovale’s pilot study specifically will enroll
												patients suspected of respiratory infections, including COVID-19
												patients, prior to conducting full validation studies. This pilot study
												is an important step in evaluating the system’s performance to rapidly
												identify the likelihood of sepsis in these patients in the emergency
												department. </p>

											<p>The pilot study represents the expansion of a larger contract, first
												launched in September 2019, which includes executing analytical and
												clinical validation studies and preparing for manufacturing scale-up and
												validation, all of which are necessary for the U.S. Food and Drug
												Administration to consider clearance of the diagnostic system.</p>

											<p>This specific study is part of BARDA’s Rapidly Deployable Capabilities
												program to identify and pilot near-term innovative solutions for
												COVID-19, leveraging the development of Cytovale’s rapid diagnostic
												system under BARDA’s Division of Research Innovation and Venture (DRIVe)
												Solving Sepsis Program.

											<p>BARDA is collaborating again with DiaSorin, this time to develop a
												clinical laboratory test to identify people who have been infected with
												the SARS-COV-2 virus but have recovered. </p>

											<p>Known as a serology assay, the test detects the presence of IgG
												antibodies specific to the virus in a person’s blood. Having certain
												levels of these immuno-protective antibodies indicates that the person
												is convalescent (recovering or recovered from COVID-19). This knowledge
												is particularly important for healthcare providers and workers in
												essential industries such as utilities and food production and may
												inform a person’s decision on when to return to work after potential
												exposure to the virus. </p>

											<p>This diagnostic test has been designed to respond to the need to identify
												people in the population who had already been infected with the virus,
												but whose diagnosis has not been confirmed by performing a swab and a
												molecular diagnostic test, or who have recovered from recent infection.
											</p>

											<p>DiaSorin's assay runs on the company’s FDA 510(k) cleared LIAISON XL
												instrument platform used routinely in hundreds of hospital and reference
												diagnostic laboratories across the U.S. The platform fully automates
												management of the diagnostic process, allowing laboratories to process
												up to 170 patient blood samples per hour, with a minimum level of
												intervention required by laboratory operators and results in less than
												45 minutes. This availability and speed increases the current capacity
												for testing to detect past infections in people who are recovering or
												recovered from COVID-19.</p>

											<p>The system is a fully automated, easy to use, quantitative detection
												platform that performs a range of immunodiagnostic assays. The platform
												consists of the automated LIAISON instrument and an immunodiagnostics
												assay workflow. </p>

											<p>This serological test is the second DiaSorin COVID-19 test to be
												supported by BARDA; the first was the Simplexa<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19
												Direct assay, a molecular test for qualitative identification of
												SARS-CoV-2 which was developed by subsidiary, DiaSorin Molecular, LLC,
												of Cypress, California.</p>

											<p>BARDA and DiaSorin entered into a public-private partnership, with BARDA
												contributing approximately $180,000 and DiaSorin funding the total
												remaining project cost.

											<p>BARDA and OraSure Technology, Inc. are working together on the
												development of a point-of-care (POC) test for SARS-CoV-2 that could
												bring testing closer to the patient. OraSure’s rapid, point-of-care test
												will be available for use both in clinical settings and at home. This
												test could become the first for use at home in the United States.</p>

											<p>No instruments or trained personnel are needed to administer the test or
												read the results. Test results are available to the user in
												approximately 20 minutes. Currently there are no rapid POC tests
												available for large volumes of testing that can be used during times of
												quarantine and social distancing. </p>

											<p>This test is a quick, non-invasive antigen detection test that has the
												potential to be deployed quickly to and assess symptomatic and
												asymptomatic acute infections shortly after the patient becomes
												infected. Availability of a POC test will allow people to be screened
												and triaged within minutes rather than waiting several days for test
												results. </p>

											<p>This test, which is built on OraSure’s OraQuick platform, will allow
												healthcare providers and agencies to distribute tests directly to an
												individual for testing, with the goal of minimizing exposure risks to
												others and reduce the threat of infecting others. Regardless if a POC or
												self-administered test, these early results would allow for faster
												diagnoses to enhance patient and community outcomes and quickly identify
												patients needing isolation. A rapid test would not only be a major step
												towards controlling this outbreak, but also benefit in preventing
												further spread of the virus by those infected. </p>

											<p>BARDA’s support for this project include funding of approximately
												$710,000 of the $1.2 million project costs and technical support in
												order for OraSure to request Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S.
												Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

											<p>Luminex has designed an assay that runs on its FDA-cleared
												ARIES<sup>®</sup> molecular diagnostic system for presence of COVID-19
												by detecting the virus in respiratory swabs. The ARIES System is
												Luminex’s sample-to-answer, six-color, real-time PCR instrument. ARIES
												assays require little training, take less than five minutes of hands-on
												time, and produce results in about two hours.</p>

											<p>The Luminex solution consists of the ARIES<sup>®</sup> System and up to
												six cassettes. Each assay cassette contains all the reagents needed for
												nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection for one sample. An
												operator adds the sample, in this case, a respiratory swab, to the
												cassette’s sample chamber, scans the sample ID and cassette, puts up to
												six cassettes in a magazine, and loads the magazine into the
												ARIES<sup>®</sup> System. The system starts automatically and reports
												results without further operator intervention. The Luminex
												ARIES<sup>®</sup> SARS-CoV-2 assay detects via PCR, two SARS-CoV-2
												targets within the “N” gene, for improved accuracy. </p>

											<p>This is the second Luminex diagnostic to be supported by BARDA. The first
												was Luminex’s NxTAG<sup>®</sup> CoV Extended Panel which received FDA
												Emergency Use Authorization on March 27, 2020.

											<p>The EZ-BAA was created to provide a streamlined process through which
												BARDA and BARDA's Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe)
												can review and accept applications for development funding of
												transformative products and technologies to protect Americans from
												health security threats. In response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, it has
												been modified to support diagnostics products that fit the profile
												outlined above. The application process is both business-friendly and
												easy to follow.</p>

											<p>Since its inception, BARDA DRIVe's EZ-BAA solicitation has averaged more
												than one abstract submission per day while active, with awards made in
												as few as 30 days. The EZ-BAA has helped transform the contracting
												process and provide innovators, entrepreneurs, and organizations with a
												simplified and rapid mechanism to partner with the U.S. government.
												BARDA will leverage this process to rapidly respond to the current
												outbreak that has been identified as a <a

												pleased to announce a partnership with Rizlab Health of New Brunswick,
												New Jersey, to develop a transformative technology to help diagnose and
												differentiate viral or bacterial infections prior to symptom onset. . If
												successful, this device will help clinicians assess patients in their
												care while the patient is at home to determine the appropriateness of
												antibiotic or antiviral use by differentiating those suffering from a
												viral infection from those infected with bacteria. This technology will
												transform the way medicine is delivered particularly to enable greater
												speed, flexibility, and access to vulnerable populations. Elderly,
												pediatric, and immunocompromised individuals would know in advance if
												they have an impending bacterial infection.</p>

											<p>RizLab Health, a spinout from Rutgers University, is developing a novel
												hand-held wireless health monitoring system that leverages its
												CytoTracker device. The Cytotracker is a pocket-size device that can
												perform complete blood counts (CBCs) from a drop of blood. This
												partnership will further develop the CytoTracker concept to enable
												patients suffering from cold symptoms to be assessed for the likelihood
												of a viral or bacterial infection.</p>

											<p>The monitoring system proposed consists of a wireless, pocket-sized,
												complete blood count analyzer which measures and differentiates various
												cell types in the blood sample. A mobile phone application will collect
												CBC data, along with user symptom information from the patient, and use
												artificial intelligence to inform the patient of the likelihood of a
												bacterial vs. viral infection. The data then can be shared with their
												physician for improved diagnosis and appropriate treatment. </p>

											<p>This research has the potential to pave the way for enhancing not only
												the diagnosis of colds and flu, but also to enhance monitoring of
												patients at home after release from the hospital for a myriad of
												conditions including sepsis. </p>

											<p>This Powered by DRIVe product is now part of DRIVe’s Early Notification

												ENACT aim to empower people by letting them know they are sick before
												the first symptom appears, encouraging early treatment and potentially
												reducing the spread of bacteria and viruses. Prompt attention to serious
												health issues can save lives and reduce overall healthcare costs.
												Innovative technologies hold the potential to strengthen the nation’s
												ability to protect Americans from health security threats and to save
												lives.</p>

											<p>To advance the development of a test that may be able to diagnose sepsis
												in less than 10 minutes, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services
												(HHS) will partner with Cytovale of San Francisco.</p>

											<p>Under the cost-sharing agreement, the Biomedical Advanced Research and
												Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant
												Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), will provide expertise
												and $3.4 million to develop design specifications for the system and
												potentially an additional $4.17 million over 2.5 years for additional
												work, including studies needed to pursue regulatory clearance through
												the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>

											<p>Cytovale’s system incorporates the latest developments in microfluidics,
												high-speed imaging, and machine learning to identify sepsis-specific
												biophysical signatures of immune cells from a small volume of blood.
												Most diagnostics focus on the molecular characteristics; instead,
												Cytovale’s system looks at biophysical properties of immune cells and
												measures the immune cell activity associated with body’s immune
												response.</p>

											<p>“We need faster diagnostics to move the needle on sepsis and reduce its
												health burden in our country,” said BARDA Director, Rick Bright, Ph.D.
												“Like so many threats, speed of diagnosis is critical to improving
												outcomes of sepsis patients. Through this and other projects, our
												Solving Sepsis program continues to focus on catalyzing technology to
												address sepsis.”</p>

											<p>Sepsis is a serious public health threat, killing approximately 270,000
												Americans each year. The condition is the result of a dysregulated
												immune response to infection which causes serious tissue damage that may
												lead to organ failure and death. Sepsis could pose an even greater
												health security threat in a chemical, biological, radiological or
												nuclear emergency, or as a complication of an influenza pandemic or
												other emerging infectious disease outbreak.</p>

											<p>The cost-sharing agreement announced today builds on work completed under
												a previous cost-sharing contract between Cytovale and BARDA’s Division
												of Research Innovation and Ventures (DRIVe). BARDA provided $749,000
												under that agreement through an EZ-BAA, or easy broad agency
												announcement.</p>

											<p>The BARDA DRIVe Solving Sepsis program is supporting development of
												several technologies that aim to increase our nation’s ability to
												respond to sepsis, including advanced development of sepsis diagnostics.
												DRIVe is also working closely with federal partners to address sepsis at
												every stage of patient care. These efforts are part of the HHS
												commitment to fully address sepsis as a medical emergency and potential
												disaster threat. </p>

											<p>BARDA DRIVe could provide an additional $6.5 million over four years
												under the cost-sharing agreement to support advanced research and
												development, validation and regulatory approval of the novel
												algorithm-based diagnostic. Beckman Coulter will work with Dascena, Inc.
												of Oakland, California, to develop the algorithm.</p>

											<p>“The ability to improve specificity for rapid detection of sepsis and
												expand this capability to all hospital units and the emergency
												department through use of electronic health record data and blood
												clinical chemistry will greatly change the field,” said BARDA Director
												Rick Bright, Ph.D. “With sepsis, every minute counts and is critical for
												a full recovery. We want to make sure we can identify sepsis in all
												patients as rapidly as possible.”</p>

											<p>The digital diagnostic solution combines “wet” and “dry” data together in
												a predictive algorithm expected to accurately detect sepsis early and
												improve patient outcomes. Wet data includes information from laboratory
												tests; dry data includes electronic health record information. This
												solution builds on Beckman Coulter’s existing Early Sepsis Indicator
												which received FDA 510K clearance in April 2019 and integration with
												Dascena’s InSight predictive algorithm for sepsis.</p>

											<p>Sepsis kills approximately 270,000 Americans each year. The condition
												results from a dysregulated immune response to infection and causes
												serious tissue damage that may lead to organ failure and death. </p>

											<p>Sepsis represents a serious public health threat and could amplify many
												health security threats in a chemical, biological, radiological or
												nuclear emergency, or as a complication of influenza or other infectious
												diseases. Sepsis is difficult to diagnose due to the heterogeneity of
												the disease and the difficulty of predicting the progression from
												infection to sepsis. </p>

											<p>This project is part of BARDA DRIVe’s Solving Sepsis program which aims
												to reduce the incidence, morbidity, mortality and cost associated with
												sepsis by taking a systems approach in key strategic areas for sepsis,
												which includes developing diagnostics that address sepsis earlier along
												the patient continuum of care. </p>

												is teaming up with the Rory Staunton Foundation for Sepsis Prevention to
												help combat maternal sepsis, one of the leading causes of
												pregnancy-related deaths in the United States and of particular concern
												in a public health emergency. The program will identify and analyze the
												risk factors associated with maternal sepsis, including the demographic
												characteristics, co-morbidities, and obstetric procedures that place
												some women at higher risk of developing sepsis that can arise from any
												infection. </p>

											<p>Maternal sepsis can occur when a severe infection develops during
												pregnancy or immediately after childbirth. In a public health emergency,
												illnesses and injuries caused by chemical, biological, radiological,
												nuclear agents can lead to secondary infections that, in turn, result in
												sepsis, putting individuals who are pregnant or who have recently been
												pregnant at risk of maternal sepsis.</p>

											<p>Through this partnership, the Rory Staunton Foundation for Sepsis
												Prevention will work in collaboration with the NY State Department of
												Health to develop and analyze a maternal sepsis dataset that will be
												made publicly available. This analysis will inform the development of
												high quality, evidence-based education and training on the early
												recognition, treatment and management of sepsis for patients and health
												care providers, helping save lives in a public health emergency. A
												series of audience-specific tools and materials designed to educate
												providers, patients, policymakers and other key stakeholders will be
												developed. Although initial launch of these materials will be in
												collaboration with NY State Department of Health, this model can be
												replicated and amplified in other states.</p>

												Health and Human Services.</p>

											<p>Sepsis kills approximately 270,000 Americans each year. The condition is
												the result of a dysregulated immune response to infection which causes
												serious tissue damage that may lead to organ failure and death. Sepsis
												is a serious public health threat, but could pose an even greater health
												security threat in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological or
												nuclear attack or incident, or as a complication of influenza or other
												infectious disease outbreak.</p>

											<p>This Powered by DRIVe project is part of DRIVe’s Solving Sepsis
												portfolio. Solving Sepsis supports the development of transformational
												technologies, including preventive and mitigation measures to reduce
												sepsis incidence, morbidity and mortality. The goal is to drive
												innovation and develop technologies and approaches that will enhance the
												nation’s ability to protect Americans from 21st century health security
												threats.</p>

											<p>DRIVe and The Rory Staunton Foundation are committed to a public-private
												partnership, with DRIVe contributing $254,662 of the total $374,776
												estimated project cost. The Foundation will fund the remaining costs.
											</p>

											<p>DRIVe is transforming the speed in which BARDA partners with industry and
												entrepreneurs. To streamline its funding mechanism, DRIVe implemented a

											<h3>Company Description (provided by the Rory Staunton Foundation for Sepsis
												Prevention)</h3>
											<p>The Rory Staunton Foundation for Sepsis Prevention was established
												following the preventable death of 12-year-old Rory Staunton from
												sepsis. As one of the leading sepsis organizations in the United States,
												the Foundation works to end the hundreds of thousands of preventable
												deaths and devastating disabilities caused by sepsis each year and to
												support those affected by the condition. Through its education and
												awareness programs, the Foundation increases understanding of the
												dangers and signs of sepsis, promotes rapid treatment, and encourages
												self-advocacy in the medical environment. The Foundation actively
												supports the establishment of mandatory sepsis protocols in each state
												to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in hospitals and other
												medical settings.</p>

											<p>BARDA DRIVe is pleased to announce a partnership with Sound Life Sciences
												(SLS) of Seattle, Washington. The startup company will deploy a
												contactless motion and respiratory monitoring technology in smart
												speakers in a cohort of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
												disease (COPD) to identify early illness onset during the influenza
												season.
												Individuals with chronic illnesses such as COPD are at increased risk
												for developing severe respiratory infections and novel ways to detect
												exposure early can improve treatment and outcomes. The smart speakers
												can be positioned up to about 2 meters away and monitor individuals
												while they sleep. Significant changes from baseline breathing patterns
												result in smartphone or telehealth notifications.</p>

											<p>This smart speaker is designed to monitor breathing at frequencies that
												people do not hear and which does not harm pets. By using SLS’s
												technology, respiratory changes - which could serve as an early
												indicator of acute respiratory infection - could be detected earlier.
												This project has the potential to result in a low cost means of
												detecting respiratory illness using commodity devices already present in
												over 90 million homes. </p>

											<p>Five accelerators will join a unique innovation accelerator network that
												provides small and start-up biotechnology innovators with technical and
												entrepreneurial support they need to accelerate the development of
												products that could transform the nation’s approach to health security
												threats. The network was established by the Biomedical Advanced Research
												and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the
												Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in 2018 with eight
												accelerators.</p>
											<p>The new accelerators expand the existing network, providing geographic
												coverage into areas of the country previously under-represented in the
												network. The five recently selected accelerators are: </p>
											<ul>
												<li>Emory University & Georgia Institute of Technology (Coulter
													Translational Program) in Atlanta, Georgia;</li>
												<li>Plug and Play Tech Center in San Francisco;</li>
												<li>University of Missouri Midwest BioAccelerator (MU-MBAr) in Columbia,
													Missouri;</li>
												<li>University Enterprise Labs in partnership with gener8tor in St.
													Paul-Minneapolis; and</li>
												<li>Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.</li>

											</ul>
											<p>“In the first year, our accelerator network reached audiences outside of
												normal government channels, fostering innovative solutions to improve
												national health security and to provide business expertise and
												laboratory space for startups and small businesses,” said Rick Bright,
												Ph.D., deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response and
												director of BARDA. “By expanding the network into new geographic
												locations, we will connect with even more companies and entrepreneurs to
												solve systemic health challenges. The network is helping to
												revolutionize the way we do business and catalyze innovation across the
												country.”</p>

											<p>To build a pipeline of products for BARDA’s Division of Research,
												Innovation and Ventures, these accelerators identify innovative products
												and solutions developed by entrepreneurs, innovators, start-ups, and
												academics around the United States to meet biodefense and other health
												security needs, and then provide these innovators with business and
												other services, such as regulatory support. Accelerators also introduce
												innovators to BARDA solicitations for funding consideration.</p>

											<p>Currently, accelerators focus on sourcing products or solutions in three
												areas of interest to BARDA’s Division of Research, Innovation and
												Ventures:</p>

											<ul>

												<li>Early Notification to Act, Control, and Treat (ENACT), which funds
													technologies and platforms that provide early, actionable
													information to detect illnesses before people even know they are
													sick; </li>
												<li>the Solving Sepsis initiative, which focuses on reducing the
													incidence, morbidity, mortality and cost of sepsis; and</li>
												<li>other disruptive innovations, which seeks radically novel
													technologies that can transform health security. </li>

											</ul>

											<p>The accelerator network began with eight accelerators located in regional
												hubs across the country where health security products and technologies
												in biotechnology, life science research, and medical innovations are
												heavily concentrated. These foundational accelerators are:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The Center for Biotechnology at Stonybrook in Long Island, New York;
												</li>
												<li>First Flight Venture Center in Raleigh, North Carolina;</li>
												<li>Life Science Washington Institute in Seattle;</li>
												<li>MedTech Innovator in Los Angeles;</li>
												<li>Massachusetts Medical Device Development Center at UMass in Lowell,
													Massachusetts;</li>
												<li>New Orleans BioInnovation Center in New Orleans;</li>
												<li>Texas Medical Center Innovation Institute in Houston; and</li>
												<li>University City Science Center in Philadelphia.</li>

												teaming up with Inflammatix, Inc. to advance development of a
												host-response-based diagnostic (HostDx&trade;-Sepsis) that can assess
												patients suspected of sepsis, separately determining presence of an
												infection as bacterial or viral and 30-day risk stratifying, to predict
												sepsis outcome.</p>

											<p>Sepsis is notoriously difficult to identify as the symptoms are common to
												several other illnesses. Having a diagnostic that can accurately
												diagnose sepsis can save lives and help facilitate appropriate treatment
												intervention. Inflammatix has developed machine learning algorithms that
												examine a locked 29-mRNA signature from whole blood and can inform on
												whether an infection is present and its source as bacterial or viral.
												This distinction is important as it allows clinicians to start the
												appropriate treatment as well as support appropriate use of antibiotics.
												Inflammatix’s HostDx-Sepsis will also simultaneously output a risk
												stratification score to help determine whether a patient has or will
												develop sepsis and to guide clinical management and intervention.</p>

											<p>Under this award, the HostDx Sepsis test will be implemented on the
												NanoString® nCounter® platform to assess potential applicability of the
												multi-RNA panel for the diagnosis of acute infections and sepsis in a
												clinical study of surgical ICU patients in which test results will be
												used to guide patient care. </p>

												the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

											<p>Sepsis kills approximately 270,000 Americans each year, many of them in
												hospital settings. The disease occurs when the body produces a
												dysregulated immune response to infection and causes serious tissue
												damage that may lead to organ failure and death. Sepsis is currently a
												serious public health threat, but could pose an even greater health
												security threat in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological or
												nuclear attack or incident, or as a complication of influenza or other
												infectious diseases.</p>

											<p>This <i>Powered by DRIVe</i> project is part of DRIVe’s Solving Sepsis
												portfolio. Solving Sepsis supports the development of transformational
												technologies, including preventive and mitigation measures to reduce
												sepsis incidence, morbidity and mortality. The goal is to drive
												innovation and develop technologies and approaches that will enhance the
												nation’s ability to protect Americans from 21st century health security

											<p>DRIVe and Inflammatix are committed to a public-private partnership, with

												quickly and painlessly under the skin with ease. The vision of this
												technology would be for healthcare providers or potentially even for
												individuals themselves to administer vaccines using this simple,
												convenient and reusable needle-free device.</p>

											<p>This public-private partnership aims to develop a cost-effective
												technological innovation to improve vaccination uptake, coverage, and
												rapid vaccine response to pandemic influenza and other emerging
												infectious diseases. For the pilot, Enesi will leverage its ImplaVax®
												platform, combining a known influenza vaccine with a needle-free vaccine
												delivery system, to test the vaccine’s immunogenicity, thermal stability
												and rapid administration. ImplaVax® could become a potentially
												disruptive technology not only for influenza, but also for a range of
												infectious diseases and biological threats.</p>

											<p>This project will involve analytical and pre-clinical evaluation of novel
												ImplaVax®-enabled solid dose implant formulations of known influenza
												vaccines in standard animal models. In-vitro tests will include
												evaluation of mechanical strength and surety of implantation. In-vivo
												testing will assess comparative immunogenicity and dosing regimens.
												Performance of solid dose implants versus placebo and active control
												vaccine delivered by needle and syringe will also be measured. The
												overall aim is to generate evidence to support the further evaluation of
												solid dose presentations as a potential alternative method of
												vaccination in a future pandemic response.</p>

												processes, helping DRIVe’s program teams continue to make awards in as
												few as 30 days.</p>

											<p>DRIVe encourages all qualified parties to submit EZ BAA abstracts via the
												Portal. However, during this transition period, the DRIVe team
												recognizes that some organizations may have begun drafting abstracts
												using the PDF form. To accommodate those organizations, DRIVe will
												continue to accept PDF forms sent to <a
													href="mailto:DRIVeContracting@hhs.gov">DRIVeContracting@hhs.gov</a>
												until May 8th, 2019. After May 8th all abstract submissions must come
												via the Portal.</p>

											<p>All of the data requested for abstract submission remains the same as the
												current process. First, you need to request a Portal Account, which will
												generally be granted within 1-3 business days. Then you will logon to
												the Portal and complete the requested information, including the
												technical and cost components. No attachments will be necessary or
												allowed. After submitting the abstract, you will receive an automated
												email confirmation. DRIVe program managers and subject-matter experts
												will then review the submission and notify you of the decision. You will
												be able to simply log back on to the system should you wish to submit
												additional proposals or resubmit a modified abstract. </p>

											<p>BARDA is excited to implement this system for submission of innovative
												projects to DRIVe. We believe it will significantly improve your
												submission experience as well as the review process. That said, we know
												that with any system there can be challenges in transition. Should you
												experience technical issues, our helpdesk is available 24/7 by calling
												800-334-8571 (x26600). For other comments or concerns, feel free to
												email the <a href="mailto:DRIVeWebmaster@hhs.gov">DRIVe Webmaster</a>.

												may ultimately differ depending on agreement structure and availability
												of funds.</p>

											<p>As part of our approach to make partnering with the government easier,
												DRIVe continues to work to streamline the application process, though
												the larger award value necessitates greater details than our successful
												EZ BAA program. We strongly recommend that you contact our <a

												Chart (1 page), White Paper (5 pages max), and Addendum (rough order of
												magnitude cost estimate, not to exceed 4 pages max). These will be
												reviewed by DRIVe, and select respondents will be invited to submit full
												proposals.</p>

											<p>DRIVe is seeking the most innovative products and technologies to protect

												two impact areas and is intended for specific targeted focus areas. We
												anticipate awards under these special instructions to be for more mature
												technologies, compared with EZ BAA submissions. Please note that our EZ
												BAA program remains active, and we encourage all potential respondents
												to consider the expedited EZ BAA abstract if your proposal is in early
												stages of development and would require a DRIVe investment under $749K.
											</p>

											<p>In-scope priority areas fall into DRIVe’s current main impact areas:
												Solving Sepsis (Area of Interest #15) and Early Notification to Act,
												Control, and Treat (ENACT) (Area of Interest #16). Each impact area has
												specific focus areas. Solving Sepsis's focus areas are <i>Advanced

											<p>The BARDA DRIVe Solving Sepsis initiative is partnering with Qvella
												Corporation of Carlsbad, California, to develop ground-breaking
												technology to diagnose infection in patients suspected of sepsis with
												assay results in 60 minutes. The new host response diagnostic system
												leverages Qvella’s FAST-ID™ pathogen identification platform based on
												revolutionary new approaches to rapid sample processing and nucleic acid
												isolation and amplification directly from whole blood.</p>

											<p>The ability to diagnose underlying infection and septic patients rapidly
												and accurately is a critical factor in saving lives, improving patient
												outcomes and making better use of healthcare resources. Sepsis is a
												serious public health threat, killing an estimated 270,000 Americans
												each year and incurring high healthcare costs. Sepsis would pose an even
												greater health security threat in the event of a chemical, biological,
												radiological or nuclear attack or incident, or as a complication of
												influenza or other infectious diseases.</p>

											<p>Sepsis occurs when the body’s efforts to fight an infection results in a
												dysregulated immune response and inflammation that can cause tissue
												damage, organ failure and death. Sepsis is difficult to diagnose and
												distinguish from other inflammatory conditions and currently can take
												days to accurately diagnose.</p>

											<p>The Qvella project combines the company’s diagnostics technology and
												expertise with Predigen Inc.’s gene signature analytical power to help
												develop the intended assay for the early diagnosis of sepsis.</p>

											<p>DRIVe (Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures) supports the
												development of innovative products and approaches that aim to solve
												major health security challenges through innovative products and
												approaches. DRIVe is an initiative of BARDA (Biomedical Advanced
												Research and Development Authority) within the U.S. Department of Health
												and Human Services.</p>

											<p>DRIVe and Qvella are committed to a public-private partnership, with
												DRIVe contributing $692,236 of the total $988,909 estimated project
												cost. Qvella will fund the remaining development costs.</p>

											<p>DRIVe is transforming the speed in which government partners with
												industry. To streamline its funding mechanism, DRIVe implemented a new
												EZ-BAA application, a business-friendly simple abstract.</p>

											<h4>Company Description (provided by Qvella)</h4>

											<p><a onclick="return confirmExit()" target="_blank">Qvella</a> is a
												molecular diagnostics company founded in 2009 by a group of scientists
												and engineers with the goal of dramatically reducing time to results in

												Field Activated Sample Treatment (FAST) technology utilizes a novel
												sample prep technique that enables rapid detection of infectious agents
												and host response biomarkers from whole blood. When implemented in
												concert with Antibiotic Stewardship programs, now being adopted by most
												major medical centers, timely clinical decisions can be made which lead
												to improved patient outcomes, reduced hospital stays, lower side effect
												profiles, and a significant reduction in treatment costs.</p>

											<p>BARDA DRIVe is pleased to announce it is partnering with Empatica of
												Cambridge, Massachusetts, to apply Empatica's wearable biomonitoring
												device toward DRIVe goals of predicting respiratory infections and
												exposures before any symptoms present.</p>

											<p>The project builds on Empatica’s Embrace2, a battery-powered wristband
												FDA-cleared as a medical device for use by people suffering from
												epilepsy. Embrace2 technology measures multiple indicators related to
												physiological parameters. Embrace has also been approved in Europe as a
												medical device to monitor seizures and alert since April 2017. Currently
												Embrace2 uses advanced machine learning to monitor physiological
												parameters, detect unusual patterns that may be associated with
												convulsive seizures, and immediately notify users and caregivers.</p>

											<p>This <i>Powered by DRIVe</i> product is now part of DRIVe’s Early
												Notification to Act Control and Treat (ENACT) portfolio. ENACT aims to
												empower people by letting them know they are sick before the first
												symptom appears, encouraging early treatment and potentially reducing
												the spread of bacteria and viruses. Prompt attention to serious health
												issues can save lives. Innovative technologies like wearable products
												also hold the potential to strengthen the nation’s ability to protect
												Americans from health security threats and to save lives.</p>

											<p>The Empatica device will be among those tested in the upcoming
												DARPA/BARDA Prometheus Influenza In-the-Home Clinical Studies to
												evaluate health signatures that can predict pathogen exposures prior to
												symptoms.</p>

											<p>DRIVe and Empatica are committed to a public-private partnership, with
												DRIVe contributing $251,454 of the total $457,189 project cost. Empatica
												will provide the remaining development costs.</p>

											<p>DRIVe was established in June 2018 to transform health security
												innovation to protect Americans from 21st century health security
												threats. DRIVe’s business-friendly EZ-BAA application process
												streamlines the ways government partners with industry.</p>

											<p>The DRIVe Solving Sepsis initiative has partnered with Immunexpress of
												Seattle, Washington, to develop ground-breaking technology that analyzes
												a patient’s immune system to diagnose sepsis rapidly, within 90 minutes.
												Immunexpress SeptiCyte™ technology is a precision diagnostic tool that
												evaluates a set of patented gene-expression biomarkers from the
												patient’s blood. The tool is being designed to use mathematical
												algorithms to differentiate sepsis and infection negative systemic
												inflammation and identify whether the sepsis infection is viral or
												bacterial.</p>

											<p>The ability to diagnose sepsis rapidly and accurately can facilitate
												faster, appropriate medical intervention, which is a critical factor in
												saving lives, improving patient outcomes and making better use of
												hospital facilities.</p>

											<p>Sepsis kills some 270,000 Americans each year and, according to the HHS
												Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, is the most <a
													href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK169005/"
													target="_blank">expensive hospital condition</a> to treat. Sepsis
												occurs when the body’s efforts to fight an infection result in a
												dysregulated immune response and inflammation that can cause serious
												tissue damage, organ failure and death. Sepsis is difficult to diagnose
												and distinguish from other inflammatory conditions and can take days to
												diagnose accurately, therefore impacting clinical decisions.</p>

											<p>Sepsis is currently a serious public health threat, but it could pose an
												even greater health security threat in the event of a chemical,
												biological, radiological or nuclear attack or incident, or as a
												complication of influenza or other infectious diseases.</p>

											<p>DRIVe (Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures) supports the
												development of innovative products and approaches, like the Immunexpress
												technology, that aim to solve major health security challenges through
												innovative products and approaches. DRIVe is an initiative of BARDA
												(Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), part of the
												Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (<a
													href="https://www.phe.gov/about/Pages/default.aspx"
													target="_blank">ASPR</a>) within the U.S. Department of Health and
												Human Services.</p>

											<p>DRIVe and Immunexpress are committed to a public-private partnership,
												with DRIVe contributing $744,739 of the total $3.2 million estimated
												project cost, and Immunexpress funding the remaining development costs.
												Immunexpress will leverage its prior experience of developing its
												FDA-cleared product (SeptiCyte™ LAB) to develop this new sepsis
												diagnostic on the Biocartis Idylla™ platform.</p>

											<p>DRIVe is transforming the speed in which government partners with
												industry. To streamline its funding mechanism, DRIVe implemented a new
												EZ-BAA application, a business-friendly simple abstract.</p>

											<h4>About Immunexpress</h4>

											<p>Immunexpress is a Seattle-based molecular diagnostic company committed to
												improving outcomes for patients suspected of sepsis. Immunexpress’
												SeptiCyte™ technology rapidly quantifies, directly from whole blood,
												specific molecular RNA biomarkers from the patient's own immune system –
												the ‘host response’. SeptiCyte™ LAB, recently cleared by the FDA, is the
												first of its kind in using the host immune system to differentiate
												systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. Detecting the
												host’s response to infection has the potential to differentiate
												infection earlier, faster and more accurately than finding the invading
												pathogen because it is independent of whether or not the pathogen is
												present in the sample. Immunexpress’ pipeline includes several
												sample-to-answer assays for near-patient testing. For more information

											<p>To educate healthcare providers on recognizing the signs of sepsis across
												the continuum of care, DRIVe and Sepsis Alliance, one of the nation’s
												leading sepsis organizations, launched a sepsis education and training
												initiative called the Sepsis Institute.</p>

											<p>The Sepsis Institute will provide high quality, evidence-based education
												and training on the recognition, treatment and management of sepsis to
												healthcare professionals. The Institute will develop and house new
												webinars and training modules created for a range of healthcare
												providers including primary care and urgent care practitioners, nursing
												staff and emergency medical services personnel.</p>

											<p>BARDA seeks to empower the healthcare professionals who are on the
												frontlines during a national health crisis to save lives, and in that
												effort early identification and prompt treatment of sepsis will be
												critical. Recognizing the earliest signs of sepsis is particularly
												challenging because many of the symptoms are shared with common
												infections.</p>

											<p>According to the Sepsis Alliance, sepsis is being increasingly recognized
												as a medical emergency, a leading cause of death and a major public
												health concern.</p>

											<p>Sepsis kills an estimated 270,000 Americans each year and occurs when the
												body’s overwhelming response to infection results in a dysregulated
												immune response that can cause serious tissue damage, organ failure and
												death. Sepsis is already a serious health issue, and in the event of a
												chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack or incident
												resulting in increased rates of infection, sepsis could pose an even
												greater health security threat.</p>

											<p>DRIVe’s Solving Sepsis program supports the development of
												transformational technologies, including preventative and mitigation
												measures to reduce sepsis incidence, morbidity and mortality as well as
												economic burden. The program is part of DRIVe’s mission to support
												transformative innovation to protect Americans from 21st century health
												security threats.</p>

											<p>DRIVe and Sepsis Alliance are committed to a establishing a
												public-non-profit organization partnership, with DRIVe contributing
												$427,248 of the total $622,248 estimated project cost to establish the
												Sepsis Institute and develop educational content. Sepsis Alliance will
												fund the remaining development costs.</p>

											<h4>About Sepsis Alliance</h4>

											<p>Sepsis Alliance is the leading sepsis organization in the U.S., with
												expertise in developing educational materials for professionals and for
												the public, reaching more than 3 million patients and providers each
												year. Sepsis Alliance is working in all 50 states to save lives and
												reduce suffering by raising awareness of sepsis as a medical emergency.
												In 2018, Sepsis Alliance launched <i><a onclick="return confirmExit()"
														href="https://www.sepsis.org/itsabouttime/" target="_blank">It’s
														About TIME&trade;</a></i> , a national initiative to create
												broader awareness of sepsis and the need for urgency in seeking
												treatment when there are signs and symptoms present.</p>

											<p>In 2011, Sepsis Alliance designated September as Sepsis Awareness Month
												to bring healthcare professionals and community members together in the
												fight against sepsis. Sepsis Alliance gives a voice to the millions of
												people who have been touched by sepsis – to the survivors, and the
												friends and family members of those who have survived or who have died.
												Since 2007, sepsis awareness in the U.S. has risen from 19% to 65%.

												The BARDA Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) is
												pleased to announce it is partnering with Biobeat Technologies Ltd. of
												Israel to develop a wearable early-warning device that monitors vital
												signs and alerts users they are getting sick before they feel symptoms.
												The project builds on Biobeat’s Wrist Watch, an FDA-cleared monitoring
												device that continuously measures blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate
												variability, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, stroke volume, cardiac
												output and index, systemic vascular resistance, sweat, skin temperature,
												and more. With funding from DRIVe, Biobeat will further develop the
												technology to track bodily changes that signal the user has potentially
												been exposed to an influenza virus or other pathogen. </p>

											<p>This <i>Powered by DRIVe</i> project is part of DRIVe’s Early
												Notification to Act, Control, and Treat (ENACT) portfolio. Products
												developed under ENACT aim to empower people by letting them know they
												are getting sick before the first symptom appears, encouraging early
												treatment of the disease and potentially reducing the spread of virus.
												Innovative technologies like wearable products also hold the potential
												to strengthen the nation’s ability to protect Americans from health
												security threats and to save lives.</p>

											<p>Biobeat’s technology is based on reflective photoplethysmography, a
												low-cost technique to detect blood volume changes in the smallest blood
												vessels of human tissue and often used non-invasively to make
												measurements at the skin surface. The data is recorded and analyzed to
												produce alerts and recommendations of clinical significance. This also
												potentially allows prediction and early warning before severe
												physiological emergencies occur. Information can be transmitted via the
												cloud to a cell phone application or data base.
												DRIVe and Biobeat are committed to a public-private partnership, with
												DRIVe contributing $599,000 of the total $954,800 project cost. Biobeat
												will provide the remaining development costs.</p>

												About Biobeat Technologies Ltd.</p>

											<p>Biobeat is a technology company that has developed continuous, wireless,
												non-invasive, accurate medical-grade monitoring devices that measure and
												record vital signs and other physiologically relevant parameters. The
												Biobeat sensor platform can detect and monitor physiological parameters
												regarded as markers for health status. This could be used to identify
												those who are pre-exposed, pre-symptomatic; post-exposed,
												pre-symptomatic; and/or post-exposed, symptomatic and asymptomatic.
												Moreover, combining these parameters with laboratory results could help
												validate and predict symptom onset. Another aim would be to monitor
												close contacts of individuals diagnosed as having flu, follow their
												health, and look for signs of infection among them, thus allowing us to
												understand the natural history of flu infection, validated by the use of
												multiple parameter analysis, supported by blood tests conducted during
												the study to identify flu or other infectious agents. For more

											<p>DRIVe is pleased to announce it is partnering with Cytovale, Inc. of San
												Francisco to develop new technology to diagnose sepsis in under 10
												minutes. Using a simple blood test, Cytovale’s technology is intended to
												measure physical changes in immune cells that occur when someone is sick
												to indicate whether a patient has sepsis.</p>

											<p>Support for the project is part of DRIVe’s ambitious Solving Sepsis
												initiative to accelerate the development of products that have potential
												to revolutionize the way sepsis is diagnosed and treated.</p>

											<p>Sepsis kills an estimated 270,000 Americans each year, with a health care
												cost of over $24 billion annually. Sepsis occurs when an infection or
												other insult to the body produces a dysregulated immune response in a
												patient, which can cause serious tissue damage, organ failure, and even
												death. The disease is difficult to diagnose, and with current laboratory
												testing, can take a long time - sometimes days - to confirm.</p>

											<p>Cytovale’s low-cost diagnostic holds the potential to provide the quick
												information emergency room healthcare providers need in the critical
												first hours and days of this often-deadly disease.</p>

											<p>The Cytovale technology takes advantage of advances in microfluidics,
												ultra-high speed imaging, computer vision, and machine learning to
												rapidly quantify immune cell dysregulation from a blood sample in
												minutes. It uses deformability cytometry to measure immune cell changes,
												like inflammation and other changes that occur when a person is getting
												sick.</p>

											<p>DRIVe’s Solving Sepsis initiative supports innovative technologies to
												prevent and reduce sepsis incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Sepsis is
												already a major public health threat, and it could pose an even bigger
												health security threat in the event of a chemical, biological,
												radiological, or nuclear attack or incident, or as a complication from
												influenza or other infectious diseases.</p>

											<p>DRIVe and Cytovale are committed to a public-private partnership, with
												DRIVe contributing $749,000 of the total $1.397 million project cost.
												Cytovale will cover the remaining development costs for this phase of
												development as a part of a cost share.</p>

											<p>DRIVe is transforming the speed in which government partners with
												industry. To streamline funding, DRIVe implemented a new
												business-friendly EZ-BAA application process enabling this award to be
												made in less than two months (55 days from submission to award).</p>

											<h4>About Cytovale</h4>

											<p>DRIVe welcomes its first partner, EnLiSense of Allen,
												Texas! DRIVe is providing research and development funding
												to accelerate development of a wearable device from
												EnLiSense that detects infections from a person’s sweat.</p>

											<p>
												This <i>Powered by DRIVe</i> award provides non-dilutive
												funding for up to 18 months and is part of DRIVe’s
												laser-like focus on transforming health security. DRIVe
												invests in disruptive innovation to protect Americans
												against 21st century health security threats.
											</p>

											<p>
												The first <i>Powered by DRIVe</i> project falls under
												DRIVe’s Early Notification to Act Control and Treat (ENACT)
												program. Products developed under ENACT empower people by
												letting them know they’re sick before they even feel sick.
											</p>

											<p>
												EnLiSense’s non-invasive SWEATSENSER diagnostics (Dx)
												Platform could become an easy-to-use wearable sensor to
												quickly detect or rule out infections. The sensor, which may
												resemble a wrist-watch, works by detecting and tracking
												multiple biomarkers, including <a
													href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cytokine"
													target="_blank">cytokine</a> levels in sweat; these levels
												may be an early warning of changes in the body.
											</p>

											<p>The SWEATSENSER could be used in a hospital setting or
												in the community to identify an influenza infection or other illness
												related to
												chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear disasters.</p>

											<p>Innovative technologies like the EnLiSense platform
												have the potential to strengthen our ability to protect
												Americans from health security threats and to save lives.</p>

											<p>This EnLiSense and DRIVe announcement is a true public
												private partnership with DRIVe providing just over $550,900
												and EnLiSense picking up a share of the cost.</p>

											<p>DRIVe is committed to transforming the speed in which
												government partners with industry. This award was made
												within one month of EnLiSense’s DRIVe EZ BAA application!</p>

												commercialization. DRIVe is particularly interested in
												learning about incubators that collaborate closely with or

												non-dilutive and non-equity incubator support that allows

										<div class="modal-body">

											<p>
												Tyler Merkeley has been appointed Interim Director of
												BARDA's new Division of Research, Innovation and Ventures
												(DRIVe). This Division represents a bold new approach to
												partnering in order to accelerate life-saving innovation in
												medical products and technologies that promise to transform
												health security. Launched in June 2018, DRIVe is a new
												division of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
												Authority (<a href="https://medicalcountermeasures.gov"
													target="_blank">BARDA</a>), a component of the HHS Office
												of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (<a
													href="https://phe.gov" target="_blank">ASPR</a>).
											</p>

											<p>"Tyler is stepping into DRIVe's leadership role at a
												critical time as we start investing in ambitious new
												approaches to identify and advance innovative products and
												technologies to empower people, save lives and protect
												Americans" said Rick Bright, Ph.D., Director of BARDA. "His
												experience in building innovative programs makes him well
												positioned to shape DRIVe's distinctive culture and develop
												the team, and lay a solid foundation for future success".</p>

											<p>
												Merkeley has played a central role in designing and
												launching DRIVe, as well as other innovative programs within
												BARDA such as <a onclick="return confirmExit()" https://prenosis.com/
													href="https://carb-x.org" target="_blank">CARB-X</a>,
												an international public private partnership focused on
												combating antibiotic resistant bacteria with over $500M
												committed from funders. He served as BARDA's CARB-X Program
												Director prior to taking on the DRIVe leadership role.
											</p>

											<p>"DRIVe is all about new approaches to identify and
												mobilize disruptive innovation through the formation of
												novel partnerships. We are building an amazing DRIVe team of
												restless innovators within the government and across our
												DRIVe partners, to identify, invest in, and accelerate
												development of products that will enhance health security."
												Merkeley said.</p>

											<p>Merkeley's appointment is effective immediately while
												a nation-wide search has begun for a permanent Director of
												DRIVe. In addition he will serve on the Joint Oversight
												Committee for CARB-X.</p>

											<p>Merkeley joined BARDA in 2009 as a Health Scientist to
												accelerate the advanced research and development,
												procurement, stockpile and sustainment of medical
												countermeasures (MCM) against chemical, biological,
												radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents under Project
												BioShield. At BARDA, he has led the smallpox antiviral
												procurement, managed BARDA's first agreement using Other
												Transaction Authority (OTA) and has served as the Acting
												Chief of Staff for BARDA. Tyler received his Masters of
												Science in Biohazard Threat Agents and Emerging Infectious
												Diseases from Georgetown University and his Masters of
												Business Administration (MBA) in Finance and International
												Business from Iona College in New York.</p>
