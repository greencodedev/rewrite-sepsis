									Information Voluntarily Submitted to HHS</h2>
								<p>If you choose to provide HHS with personal information --
									for example by completing a "Contact Us" form, leaving a
									comment, sending email, or completing a survey -- we may use
									that information to respond to your message and/or help us get
									you the information or services you requested. Submitting
									personal information (name, address, telephone number, email
									address, etc.) is voluntary and is not required to access
									information on our website.</p>
								<p>We retain the information only for as long as necessary
									to respond to your question or request, in most cases no longer
									than three months. Information submitted electronically is
									maintained and destroyed as required by the Federal Records Act
									and records schedules of the National Archives and Records
									Administration. It may be subject to disclosure in certain
									cases (for example, if required by a Freedom of Information Act
									request, court order, or Congressional access request, or if

									required to provide consent before HHS collects, uses, or
									shares personal information from a child under age 13.</p>
								<p>Information and instructions will be provided by the
									specific Web page that collects information about a child. The
									Web page will specify exactly what the information will be used
									for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.</p>

								<h2>Visiting an Official HHS Page on Third-Party Websites</h2>
								<p>We maintain accounts on third-party websites, such as
									social media sites, as tools to better interact with the
									public. The security and privacy policies of third-party
									websites apply to your activity on those sites. Users of
									third-party websites often share information with the general
									public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the
									website. You should review the privacy policies of all websites
									before using them and ensure that you understand how your
									information may be used. You should also adjust privacy
									settings on your account on any third-party website to match
									your preferences.</p>

								<h2 id="third-party-websites">Information Collected and
									Used from Third-Party Websites</h2>
								<p>
									If you have an account/profile with a third-party website, and
									choose to follow, like, friend, or comment on a third-party
									website managed by HHS, certain personal information associated
									with your account may be made available to us based on the
									privacy policies of the third-party website and your privacy
									settings within that website. <strong>We do not share
										personally identifiable information made available through
										these websites.</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									HHS conducts and publishes a Privacy Impact Assessment for each
									use of a third-party website. Each use of a third-party website
									may have unique features or practices. HHS sometimes collects
									and uses the information made available through third-party
									websites. To learn more, review the <a id="anch_56"
										href="http://www.hhs.gov/pia/">published
										assessments</a>.
								</p>

								<h2 id="information-automatically-stored">Information
									Automatically Collected and Stored</h2>
								<p>When you browse through our website, we use Google’s
									Universal Analytics (UA) software to gather and temporarily
									store a variety of information about your visit. However, this
									information cannot be used to identify you as an individual.
									The basic information we collect during your visit includes:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The name of the domain you use to access the Internet
										(for example, Verizon.com, if you are using a Verizon online
										account, or stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford
										University's domain);</li>
									<li>The date and time of your visit to our website;</li>
									<li>The pages and documents you viewed on our website;</li>
									<li>The URL of the website you visited prior to ours;</li>
									<li>The type and version of your Web browser and operating
										system; and</li>
									<li>Your location at the time of your visit, down to the
										city-level</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We do not associate any of the data we collect with you as an
									individual. Instead, we aggregate this data from all visits in
									order to improve our website and provide a better user
									experience to our visitors. The aggregate data is available
									only to Web managers and other designated staff who require
									this information to perform their duties. It is retained only
									for as long as needed for proper analysis. The Google Analytics
									Privacy Policy is available at <a id="anch_57"

								<p>On some portions of our website we have enabled Universal
									Analytics (UA), and other third-party software (listed below),
									to provide aggregate demographic and interest data of our
									visitors. This information cannot be used to identify you as an
									individual. While these tools are used by some websites to
									serve advertisements, HHS only uses them to measure demographic
									data. HHS has no control over advertisements served on other
									websites. For each listed software, we have included links to
									Web pages where you can opt-out of having these tools collect
									data and/or serve you interest-based advertising.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>DoubleClick</strong>: HHS uses DoubleClick to

									<a id="anch_67"
										href="http://www.govdelivery.com/privacy">http://www.govdelivery.com/privacy</a>.
								</p>

									<strong>Tynt</strong>: HHS uses Tynt to improve the ease of
									link creation in copied-and-pasted content for website visitors
									and identify which content is copied-and-pasted. When an HHS
									website visitor copies content and pastes it into another
									document, a link back to the original content may be

									Information from you.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Voice of Consumer</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span>
									HHS uses the
									Voice of Consumer survey tool to collect feedback from HHS
									website visitors. The Voice of Consumer tool is implemented on
									HHS websites both as on-page surveys and pop-up surveys. HHS
									uses survey results to measure visitor satisfaction with HHS
									websites. This survey tool does not require users to submit
									personally identifiable information. The survey reports are
									available only to HHS managers, members of the HHS
									Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who
									require this information to perform their duties.
								</p>

								<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
								<p>Websites can automatically place small text files, known
									as "cookies," on the computers of their visitors. So long as
									they do not expire or get deleted, cookies identify the unique
									browser used by the visitor. On each subsequent visit to the
									website, the visitor’s browser will retrieve the cookie,
									allowing us to aggregate the number of return visitors. HHS
									uses "cookies" to test and optimize our website design and
									content. We use two types of cookies on our websites:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>We use <strong>session cookies</strong> to gather data
										for technical purposes, such as improving navigation through
										our website and generating statistics about how the website is
										used. Session cookies are temporary text files that expire
										when you leave our website. When cookies expire, they are
										automatically deleted from your computer. <strong>We
											do not use session cookies to collect personal information,
											and we do not share data collected from session cookies.</strong></li>
									<li>We use <strong>multi-session cookies</strong>, or
										persistent cookies, to customize our website for frequent
										visitors and to test variations of website design and content.
										Multi-session cookies are cookies that are stored over more
										than a single session on your computer. <strong>We do
											not use multi-session cookies to collect personal
											information, and we do not share data collected from
											multi-session cookies</strong>. Our multi-session cookies are set to
										expire no more than two years after your last visit to our
										website. After two years, they are automatically deleted from
										your computer. HHS is unable to identify an individual by
										using such technologies.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									You can take actions to block cookies by <a id="anch_69"
										href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml">opting
										out</a> <a title="Website disclaimer" id="anch_70"
										href="http://www.hhs.gov/disclaimer.html" target="_blank"><i
											class="fa fa-external-link text-muted"></i></a>. Blocking session
									cookies from your computer will not affect your access to the
									content and tools on our website. Blocking multi-session or
									persistent cookies may affect the personalization of the
									information on those sites.
								</p>

								<h2 id="web-security">Website Security</h2>
								<p>This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is
									protected by federal laws. You can be arrested and prosecuted
									for violating these laws.</p>
								<p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this
									service remains available to all users, we use software
